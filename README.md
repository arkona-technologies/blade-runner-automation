# Blade Runner Automation

Welcome to the **Blade Runner Automation** repository! This repository contains helper functions and scripts written in TypeScript to facilitate the automation of AT300 processing blades. If you're working with AT300 blades and looking to streamline your automation processes, you're in the right place.

## Features

- **Helper Functions:** Includes a collection of TypeScript helper functions tailored for AT300 processing blades.
- **Scripts:** Pre-written scripts for common automation tasks, helping you save time and effort in your workflow.

## Requirements
- git
- node.js (v20.11 LTS)
## Getting Started

To get started with Blade Runner Automation, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/arkona-technologies/blade-runner-automation.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```
   npm install
   ```

   **Compile TypeScript**
   ```
   npx tsc
   ```

3. **Usage:**

   - Utilize the provided helper functions and scripts in your TypeScript projects.
   - Refer to the documentation and comments within the code for usage instructions and examples.
  
   - Call the scripts indivually like so:
   - 
     ```<ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES> node build/base.js```
     
     ```<ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES> node build/sdi_ip.js```

4. **Configuration:**
   - The pre-made scripts use environment variables for configuration.
   - Copy the example `.env` file provided in the repository and customize it according to your needs.

## Examples

### IP Settings

This changes the IP addresses of the blade's ports. 
To do this, first change the IP addresses in the "ip-setup-example.json" or "ip-config.example.json" files. 

If you want to use VLAN tagging, you can see how to do this in the "ip-config.example.json" file. 

After making the changes, save the files and execute the following command. It is important that the variable "NETWORK_CONFIG" is set with a .json file with the IP addresses. 

The whole command looks like this, for example: 

```
URL_BLADE=http://172.16.182.2 NETWORK_CONFIG=ip-setup-example.json node --loader ts-node/esm src/ip-setup.ts
```

### Base Setup

This resets the blade, ensures that the loaded application is _AVP_100GbE_ and locks PTP clock and genlock to PTP domain 127, sets the PTP mode to slave, sets the PTP response type to multicast and the nmos registry to 172.16.0.53:30010. 
You can also set the number of SDI outs, as in this example to the number of 8. 


```
URL_BLADE=http://172.16.182.2 FPGA=AVP_100GbE PTP_MODE=SlaveOnly PTP_DOMAIN=127 PTP_RESPONSE_TYPE=Unicast NMOS_REGISTRY=http://172.16.0.53:30010 NUM_SDI_OUT=8 node --loader ts-node/esm src/base.ts
```

### SDI->IP

Expecting a previously configured Blade, this will Stream the supplied SDI Input (in this case 0)
to 2110-20 and stream it's embedded audio via a configurable
amount (in this example 4) transmitters to 2110-30.

```
URL_BLADE=http://172.16.210.107 SDI_INDEX=0 NUM_AUDIO=4 node --loader ts-node/esm src/sdi_ip.ts
```

### Set Transmitter Multicast Addresses

Assuming N Transmitters have been set up we may want to change their destination multicast addresses in one move. The supplied _set_addresses_from_csv_
Function may be used to utilize a .csv file for easy addresss assignment. An example .csv file describing the layout can be found in this repository.

For Example:

```
URL_BLADE=http://172.16.210.107 CSV_PATH=/path/to/some/file.csv node --loader ts-node/esm src/addresses.ts
```
